# Communication networks: Analysing TCP, UDP and building a files http server
As a part of the Communication Networks excercise, under Question 3, we built a simple http 1.1 server for files downloading, given a file path.
In addition, the none-coding part of the exercise focused on analysing TCP and UDP communication protocols using wireshark, for deep understanding of both, in emphasis of the segmentation and fragmentation processes.
